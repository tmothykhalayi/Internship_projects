This repository contains several web applications and tools that demonstrate various programming and web development skills. Below are brief descriptions of each project:

1.**A BASIC TO-DO WEBAPP**
A simple to-do web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can add, edit, mark as completed, and delete tasks, helping them manage their day-to-day activities.

2. **Calculator**
A web-based calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this tool provides an easy-to-use interface for simple calculations.

3. **Portfolio Website**
A personal portfolio website showcasing various projects, skills, and experience. It includes a resume section, project portfolio, contact form, and links to social media profiles. The website is fully responsive and designed for professional use.

4. **Landing Page**
A visually appealing and responsive landing page template, ideal for marketing, product launches, or event promotions. The page includes a call to action (CTA) button, basic navigation, and a clean, attractive layout built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

5 **Secure Authentication**
A secure user authentication system built with Python (Flask/Django) that implements features such as user registration with password hashing, secure login, and role-based access control. The project also includes session management and database integration with SQLite/PostgreSQL for handling user data securely.

6.**Temperature Converter**
A web application that converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this tool provides a simple interface for quick and accurate temperature conversions.


7. **password generator**
This Python program generates random passwords based on user-defined criteria, including length and character types such as uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. The user specifies the desired password length and selects which character sets to include. The program ensures that at least one character from each selected set is included in the password, then shuffles the characters for added randomness. The generated password is displayed, and the program continues to prompt for new passwords until the user chooses to stop. The password length must be at least 6 characters for security, and the user must select at least one character type.

8. **Rock, paper, scissors game**
This Python program lets you play the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game against the computer. You input your choice, and the computer randomly selects rock, paper, or scissors. The program compares the choices and announces whether you win, lose, or tie based on the game's rules. The game continues until you choose to quit by typing "quit". It's a simple, fun way to play the game interactively through the terminal.
9. **Number Guessing game**
This Python program is a number guessing game where the user must guess a number between 1 and 10,000. The program generates a random number, and the user is prompted to input guesses. After each guess, the program provides hints, telling the user if their guess is too high or too low. The game continues until the user guesses the correct number, and the program displays the number of attempts taken. The program ensures the user inputs valid numbers and gives feedback to help them guess the correct number.

These projects are designed to demonstrate various web development and programming skills, ranging from front-end development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to back-end authentication (Flask/Django, Python). Each project can be accessed by cloning the repository and opening the relevant HTML files or running the Python-based applications locally.
